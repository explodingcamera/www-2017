# This is my personal Website.

The tech stack is complete overkill for a site like this but the performance is still decent because I heavily use code splitting and follow best practices.
This site will also be the foundation for web experiments living in the same repo/webapp so I don't have to create a lot of boilerplate code.

The webpack config is based on the one I also use for my project-v but having to update multiple webpack configs is a pain so I have fix that when some spare time.

I'm not doing serverside rendering but I would recommend that you use a static site generator like ![gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) or a framework that supports serverside rendering like ![next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js).
